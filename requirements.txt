Flask
pymongo[srv]  # [srv] is needed for MongoDB Atlas DNS seed list connections
python-dotenv
werkzeug      # For password hashing (comes with Flask but good to list)
Flask-Login   # For user session management (optional but recommended for auth)
bcrypt        # Better password hashing
# Add other libraries like Flask-WTF for forms if needed
